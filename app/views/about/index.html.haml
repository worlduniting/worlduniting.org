		%h2 Mission
		%hr
			%p 
				World Uniting’s mission is to provide outreach and education to majority people groups on behalf 
				of underrepresented persons for religiously and socially conflicting issues. World Uniting’s uniqueness 
				is its approach, bringing conversation to majority opinions by speaking within their framework and point 
				of view, in order to provide empathy, awareness, and repo- sitioning of majority policies that 
				alienate minority persons.
		%h2 Vision
		%hr
			%p
				World Uniting envisions a world where uniqueness is valued for the challenge it provides to the 
				presumption of the majority, where family is a choice for understanding over conformity.
